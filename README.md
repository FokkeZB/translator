# Translator

This is a small but helpful file in translating your ([Titanium](http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#!/guide/Titanium_Command-Line_Interface_Reference)) apps.

# How to use

1. Copy the `index.php` to a server.
2. Secure the directory by using `.htaccess` or just giving it a random name.
3. Copy your app's `i18n` directory to the same folder.
4. Point people to the URL to translate the strings.
5. Download the `i18n` directory back to your app or use [ti-i18n](https://nodei.co/npm/ti-i18n/) to merge the files with your local copies if you have made local changes as well.
